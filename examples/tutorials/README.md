# RabbitMQ tutorials

This directory contains the [RabbitMQ tutorials][rabbitmq-tutes],
ported to amqplib.

## Preparation

To run the tutorial code, you need amqplib installed. Assuming you are
in a clone of the amqplib repository, from the tutorials directory:

    npm install ../..

Then just run each file as a script, e.g., in bash

    ./send.js

or

    node send.js

or

    nave use 0.8 node send.js

## [Tutorial one: Hello World!][tute-one]

A "Hello World" example, with one script sending a message to a queue,
and another receiving messages from the same queue.

 * [send.js](send.js)
 * [receive.js](receive.js)

## [Tutorial two: Work queues][tute-two]

Using RabbitMQ as a work queue; `new_task` creates a task, and
`worker` processes tasks. Multiple `worker` process will share the
tasks among them. Long-running tasks are simulated by supplying a
string with dots, e.g., '...' to `new_task`. Each dot makes the worker
"work" for a second.

 * [new_task.js](new_task.js)
 * [worker.js](worker.js)

## [Tutorial three: Publish/Subscribe][tute-three]

Using RabbitMQ as a broadcast mechanism. `emit_log` sends a "log"
message to a fanout exchange, and all `receive_logs` processes receive
log messages.

 * [emit_log.js](emit_log.js)
 * [receive_logs.js](receive_logs.js)

// === Public API, declaring queues and stuff ===

/*
Assert a queue into existence. This will bork the channel if the queue
already exists but has different properties; values supplied in the
`arguments` table may or may not count for borking purposes (check the
broker's documentation). If you supply an empty string as `queue`, or
don't supply it at all, the server will create a random name for you.

`options` is an object and may also be omitted. The options are:

- `exclusive`: if true, scopes the queue to the connection (defaults
  to false)

- `durable`: if true, the queue will survive broker restarts, modulo
  the effects of `exclusive` and `autoDelete`; this defaults to true
  if not supplied, unlike the others

- `autoDelete`: if true, the queue will be deleted when the number of
  consumers drops to zero (defaults to false)

- `arguments`: additional arguments, usually parameters for some kind
  of broker-specific extension e.g., high availability, TTL.

RabbitMQ extensions can also be supplied as options. These typically
require non-standard `x-*` keys and values sent in the `arguments`
table; e.g., `x-expires`. Here, I've removed the `x-` prefix and made
them options; they will overwrite anything you supply in `arguments`.

- `messageTtl` (0 <= n < 2^32): expires messages arriving in the queue
  after n milliseconds

- `expires` (0 < n < 2^32): the queue will be destroyed after n
  milliseconds of disuse, where use means having consumers, being
  declared (or checked, in this API), or being polled with a `get`.

- `deadLetterExchange` (string): an exchange to which messages
  discarded from the queue will be resent. Use `deadlLetterRoutingKey`
  to set a routing key for discarded messages; otherwise, the
  message's routing key (and CC and BCC, if present) will be
  preserved. A message is discarded when it expires or is rejected, or
  the queue limit is reached.

- `maxLength` (positive integer): sets a maximum number of messages
  the queue will hold. Old messages will be discarded (dead-lettered
  if that's set) to make way for new messages.

// Working with messages

/*
Publish a single message on the connection. The mandatory parameters
(these go in the publish method itself) are:

 - `exchange` and `routingKey`: the exchange and routing key, which
 determine where the message goes. A special case is sending `''` as
 the exchange, which will send directly to the queue named by the
 routing key.

The remaining parameters are optional, and are divided into those that
have some meaning to RabbitMQ and those that will be ignored by
RabbitMQ.

The former options are a mix of fields in BasicDeliver (the method
used to publish a message), BasicProperties (in the message header
frame) and RabbitMQ extensions which are given in the `headers` table
in BasicProperties.

Used by RabbitMQ and sent on to consumers:

 - `expiration` (string): if supplied, the message will be discarded
   from a queue once it's been there longer than the given number of
   milliseconds. In the specification this is a string; numbers
   supplied here will be coerced.

 - `userId` (string): If supplied, RabbitMQ will compare it to the
   username supplied when opening the connection, and reject messages
   for which it does not match.

 - `CC` (array of string): an array of routing keys as strings;
   messages will be routed to these routing keys in addition to that
   given as the `routingKey` parameter. This will override any value
   given for `CC` in the `headers` parameter. *NB* The property names
   `CC` and `BCC` are case-sensitive.

Used by RabbitMQ but not sent on to consumers:

 - `mandatory` (boolean): if true, the message will be returned if it
   is not routed to a queue (i.e., if there are no bindings that match
   its routing key).

 - `deliveryMode` (boolean): if true, the message will survive a
   broker restart. Default is false. (In the specification this is
   either `1` meaning non-persistent, or `2` meaning
   persistent. That's just silly though)

 - `BCC` (array of string): like `CC`, except that the value will not
   be sent in the message headers to consumers.

Ignored by RabbitMQ and not sent to consumers:

 - `immediate` (boolean): return the message if it is not able to be sent
   immediately to a consumer. No longer implemented in RabbitMQ

Ignored by RabbitMQ (but may be useful for applications):

 - `contentType` (string): a MIME type for the message content

 - `contentEncoding` (string): a MIME encoding for the message content

 - `headers` (object): application specific headers to be carried
   along with the message content. The value as sent may be augmented
   by extension-specific fields if they are given in the parameters,
   for example, 'cc', since these are encoded as message headers; the
   supplied value won't be mutated.

 - `priority` (0..9): a notional priority for the message; presently
   ignored by RabbitMQ

 - `correlationId` (string): usually used to match replies to
   requests, or similar.

 - `replyTo` (string): often used to name a queue to which the
   receiving application must send replies, in an RPC scenario (many
   libraries assume this pattern)

 - `messageId` (string): arbitrary application-specific identifier for
   the message

 - `timestamp` (positive number): a timestamp for the message

 - `type` (string): an arbitrary application-specific type for the
   message

 - `appId` (string): an arbitrary identifier for the originating
   application

- `noLocal` (boolean): in theory, if true then the broker won't
